2.8.0
- providing more binary names: indi_pylibcamera, indi_pylibcamera2, indi_pylibcamera3, ... indi_pylibcamera5
  this allows to run up to 5 driver instances for different cameras:
  * separate INI and CONFIG files for the driver instances
  * default camera device can be set in INI
  * changed code to kill existing driver instances
- fixed bug in finding the INI files in installation path
- updated README.md with description of the new features

2.7.0
- implemented Mono frame
- scaled RGB and Mono frames have now binning-factor in FITS header
- minor code cleanup and optimization
- minimized FITS metadata to avoid trouble with plate solver
- moved folders CamerInfos and testpattern out of Python library

2.6.5
- running old driver gets killed when started with `python3` and `python`
- fixed typo in label "Disconnect"

2.6.4
- fixed maximum exposure time for cameras reporting max < min (for instance for IMX296)

2.6.3
- fixed installation issues

2.6.2
- fixed ROWORDER attribute in FITS files (KStars/EKOS ignores this but some postprocessing tools need this fix to
  have the Bayer pattern in the correct order)
- more details in install_requires of the wheel
- adapted install instructions in README.md to meet newer OS versions (installation in virtual environment)
- removed indi_pylibcamera_postinstall from installation: does not work from virtual environment

2.6.0
- support for monochrome cameras
- support for new raw and RGB frame formats (including monochrome)
- disable astropy to download the latest IERS-A table from internet to avoid errors during observation session
- better stability of exposure loop

2.5.0
- fixed changed data alignment in Pi 5 raw images

2.4.0
- added INI switch "force_Restart" and implemented camera restart (solves crashes for IMX290 and IMX519)
- forwarding log messages to client

2.3.0
- update FITS header formatting and timestamps
- use lxml for construction of indi_pylibcamera.xml
- renamed SwitchVector FRAME_TYPE(FRAMETYPE_RAW, FRAMETYPE_PROC) to CCD_CAPTURE_FORMAT(INDI_RAW, INDI_RGB)
  to better support AstroDMX
- removed "setSitchVector CCD_ABORT_EXPOSURE" after each exposure start (that did not allow CCDciel to run
  exposures in loop)
- reworked handling of CCD_ABORT_EXPOSURE
- fixed Fast Exposure

2.2.0
- fixed Bayer pattern order for HQ camera (pycamera2 or libcamera have change they way they report Bayer pattern order),
  BAYERPAT in FITS does not depend on "Rotation" property anymore (force_Rotation has no effect anymore),
  but Bayer pattern can now be forced with force_BayerOrder
- sorting raw modes by size and bit depth to make the mode with most pixel and most bits/pixel the default
- saving and loading configurations
- bug fix: after aborting an exposure the camera stayed busy and EKOS field solver could not start a new exposure

2.1.0
- fixed division by 0 when focal length equals 0
- improved driver exit when indiserver is closed (to avoid driver continue to run)
- more transparent implementation of snooping; snooped values are now also available as driver parameter
  (in tab "Snooping")
- removed empty line and XML declaration from driver XML
- added driver vectors for camera controls (allows to enable automatic exposure control and AWB)
- added uninstall instructions in README.md
- minor improvements

2.0.0
- packaged for pip installation
